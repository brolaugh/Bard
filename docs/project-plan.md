# Project plan for Bard

## Summary
Bard is an android app that helps you on your adventures in Dungeons and Dragons by removing the in game roll calculations and does it for you leaving you to do more role-playing.

## Goal
The goal of this project is for me ([Hannes Kindströmmer](https://github.com/brolaugh)) to dive deeper into the world of android development along with Dungeons and Dragons.

## Extend of Features
The primary goal is to have feature 1-5 implemented; listed below. However if those features are done ahead of the the other features will be implemented as well.

1. Roll all the different variaties of dice
* Create a character sheet
* Do rolls that implement the different stats from the character sheet
* Keep track of hit points
* Character creation help like stat rolls (Roll a set of six 20-dice at the same time)
* Saving the character to the cloud and fetch it using an account
* Grouping accounts together into a playing group making the DM able to see the player's stats
* Allow the DM to share images such as map and monsters to the players


## Conditions
In order for this project to succeed it is required by [Hannes Kindströmmer](https://github.com/brolaugh) to stay motivated and ask for help whenever he's stuck. It is also important that a connection to the internet is maintained on a regular basis in order to browse code help sites such as [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

## Risks
One of the risks of hosting your code on Github is that Github could potentially (and not likely) shut down any day. Leaving the developer to try to recreate the issues again from memory in order to restore the time plan. An other risk that this project will face is incompetence which will slow down the development process and if it's too high that will lead to delays which will then lead to the project not being finished in time. Another delaying risk is that there's alot of unplanned lectures. Another risk that will happen is that Hannes wont ask for help when gotten stuck creating a huge delay of the project the question is how much this will happen. Planning is also one of Hannes' weak points making it so that if he fails to plan things right and to the extent needed things will get very messy... To finish of the risks there is a chance that Hannes gets sick or even dies making it hard to finish the project. plannering,
